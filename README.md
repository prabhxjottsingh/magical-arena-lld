# Magical Arena Battle Project

## Overview

This project implements a magical arena battle system where players can initiate battles and engage in epic showdowns. It manages battle initiation requests, processes battles, and provides responses to players.

## Project Structure

The main components of the project include:

-   **Constants:** Centralizes important values used throughout the project.
-   **Error Handling:** Implements robust error handling mechanisms.
-   **Handlers:** Contains the core logic for initiating and processing battles.
-   **Modals:** Defines data structures such as API responses, player data, and battle requests.

## Technologies Used

The project is built using the following technologies:

-   **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime environment.
-   **TypeScript:** A statically typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

-   **Node.js (>= 12.x)**: The JavaScript runtime environment required to execute the project.
-   **npm (Node Package Manager)**: A package manager for Node.js, used to install project dependencies.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Running the Project

To compile the TypeScript code and run the project, execute the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

## Running Tests

To run tests, execute the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

## Code Flow

## 1. Entry Point: `index.ts`

-   The project's entry point is the `index.ts` file.
-   It imports necessary modules and sets up the initial environment for the project.
-   `index.ts` defines functions for initiating arena battles and handles success and error responses.

## 2. Handlers: `battle-handler.ts`

-   The `BattleHandler` class in `battle-handler.ts` contains the main logic for initiating and processing battles.
-   It receives battle initiation requests and coordinates the battle process.
-   Within the `BattleHandler`, battles are initiated and processed based on the provided data.

## 3. Data Structures: 
- Following are the data modals `magical-arena.ts`, `player.ts`, `player-data.ts`.

-   The project defines various data structures such as player information, battle requests, and API responses.
-   These data structures are used throughout the project for managing player data, representing battle requests, and forming API responses.

## 4. Constants: `constants.ts`

-   The `constants.ts` file centralizes important values used across the project.
-   It defines constants such as success response messages, error response messages, and other configurable values.

## 5. Error Handling

-   The project implements robust error handling mechanisms to manage different error scenarios effectively.
-   Errors are handled at various levels, including parsing JSON data, initiating battles, and processing battle requests.
-   Custom error messages and responses are provided to ensure clarity and ease of debugging.

## 6. Success and Error Responses

-   Upon successful execution, the project generates a success response containing appropriate data.
-   In case of errors during execution, the project generates an error response with relevant error messages.
-   Success and error responses are constructed based on predefined formats and are returned to the caller accordingly.

## 7. Testing: `index.test.ts`

-   The `index.test.ts` file contains test cases to ensure the reliability and correctness of the project.
-   It includes unit tests for functions like initiating arena battles, handling success responses, and managing error scenarios.
